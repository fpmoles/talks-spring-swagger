# Document more with less suck using Swagger with Spring
i Leveraging swagger ui documentation with Spring MVC based webservices

## Abstract
Documentation of web service APIs sucks at the very best. It is almost always an after thought when a consume starts asking questions of how to use your API. Once you document your service APIs, a new problem arises, it is stale with the next deployment, and like before updating it is an after thought.

Enter into the picture Swagger doc and swagger ui.  With Swagger, we can get basic documentation almost for free, and with just a few simple annotations you get even descriptive documentation of your service APIs.

In this talk, we will address the benefits of using Swagger and Swagger UI in our Spring Boot micro service applications to build documentation. We will also investigate the real world benefits of making this part of your default Spring Boot template. We will also expand on some thoughts around building a service catalog with Swagger doc and simple service discovery.

## Format
This talk is designed for 50-60 min conversations on leveraging tools in the Spring Framework.
